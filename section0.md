# A study of traffic crashes in the city of Tempe, Arizona USA

***

## 1 Introduction
 
In 2019 the city of Tempe committed to be part of [Vision Zero](https://www.tempe.gov/government/transportation-and-sustainability/transportation/vision-zero) and published their [Action Plan](https://www.tempe.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/74455) for the project.

Now, what is Vison Zero you might ask? The [Vision Zero Network](https://visionzeronetwork.org/about/what-is-vision-zero/#:~:text=Vision%20Zero%20is%20a%20strategy,momentum%20in%20major%20American%20cities.) describes the initiative as follows:

_"Vision Zero is a strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable mobility for all. First implemented in Sweden in the 1990s, Vision Zero has proved successful across Europe â€” and now it's gaining momentum in major American cities."_

This page is dedicated to aiding Vision Zero by providing new analyses and insights to both decision makers (local government) as well as citizens of Tempe. [Traffic crashes data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/1-08-crash-data-report-detail-498c3?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2gojdIAxiOMs5ieTM0OfPH9MRPHGxzhgibobwIDFZ-Q_a3sfCUwDDjulc_aem_AfOI4PVUgDLCxCQPW-KQRHPDK12C9L5KYSnbZi0UdAEu0idNK3ofrogdHd3BliKSjuNfI4PJcuzTLqxwJT-HwPpS) collected by the City of Tempe from 2012-2022 is used throughout this page and totals around 46,000 crashes.

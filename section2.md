# 3 When do accidents happen?

For both the police force as well as citizens of Tempe, it is valuable to know _when_ accidents happen. Toggle between the different plots, to see when different types of accidents happen.

When we consider _All Traffic Accidents_, we see a significant increase in accidents during rush hours on week days. Here, significantly more crashes occur when people commute _from_ work rather than _to_ work. If assuming approximately the same number of people commute to and from work every day, this most likely means that drivers are less attentive in the afternoon. This conclusion fits well with an [investigation](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/overview/crashes-by-time-of-day-and-day-of-week/) carried out by the National Safety Counsil in 2021, where between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. was found to be the most dangerous time of the day to be on the road. Different reasons are given to this such as: mid-afternoon energy slumps, sending text messages to partner, and general multi-tasking such as wrapping up the last work calls and emails.

When considering _Severe injury Traffic Accidents_ (serious/incapacitating injury or death), we see that the evenings and nights lead to more severe injury accidents. However, there is no apparent difference between a week day and the weekend.

When considering crashes involving a pedestrian or a cyclist, occurances are somewhat equally distributed along all hour or the day and all days of the week.

Crashes involving alcohol or druges are primarily occuring during the night time. Here, almost just as many crashes occur on week days as weekends, with the only major difference being the increased number of crashes between 4 am and 5am on weekends. This makes sense as people generally are out later on weekends.

## 3.1 Alcohol and drugs

Knowing that alcohol and drugs are a factor in crashes, we wanted to investigate if the involvement of alcohol or drugs in general increases the likelyhood of a severe injuries or deaths.

## 2 Where do accidents happen?

Heat map

Changes over time

First, let's take a look at where crashes happen. Pictured below is an animated heat map of all crashes in each year between 2012-2022. Not surprisingly, most accidents occur on the biggest roads with the largest volume of cars. Moreover, we see a clear trend of more crashes happening around intersections, traffic lights, or other road infrastructure.

To look into whether or not Vision Zero already has managed to bring traffic crashes down since its launch in 2019, we consider the number of crashes occurring each year:

(PLOT HERE)

We see a clear drop in accidents in 2020, but then a steady increase in the two years following. This suggests that the trend seen is due to Covid-19 rather than the City of Tempe successfully improving the traffic infrastructure and regulations.

Some of the changes already implemented by Vision Zero include: speed limit changes, intersection improvements, and traffic safety devices installed around schools. As it is not disclosed exactly where these changes have been implemented, we will instead see if we can spot them by checking if a decrease in crashes is visible.

Pictured below are the locations of all crashes in Tempe colored according to their year (<span style="color:red;">2012</span>-<span style="color:blue;">2022</span>).  The major schools and universities have been circled in black, and roads or intersections which appear to have become safer during the investigated time period are circled in green.

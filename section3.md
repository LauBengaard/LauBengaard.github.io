## 4 What causes accidents?
At last a closer look on factors causing the accidents on the road, where both characteristics of the drivers and external characteristics as intersection type and light condition is looked into. 

### 4.1 Characterisation of drivers

Female/ male

Age

### 4.2 Most common violation

The top six violation types when considering accidents in the time period of 2012-2022 are:
1. Speed To Fast For Conditions
2. Failed To Yield Right Of Way
3. Unsafe Lane Change
4. Unknown
5. Followed Too Closely
6. Disregarded Traffic Signal

The figure below shows the share of total accidents per year of each of the violation types above. Use the checkbox at the right to display or hide the desired violation types. The most common violation 'Speed To Fast For Condition' has had an interesting devolopment during the period. From 2014-2017 speeding accounted for 40% of the accidents every year, and then dropped heavily the following two years. Though, the years during covid-19 with fewer cars on the road the share of accidents related to speeding increased as well. Perhaps the fewer cars on the roads, allowed the drivers to drive without being hindered by traffic and thereby drove too fast more easily. Disregared Traffic Signal had a increasing share in accidents during covid-19 as well, whereas the share of Unsafe Lane Change decreased, which might also be due to fewer cars and therefore lower risk at endanger other drivers when changing lane. At last the violation 'Followed Too Closely' has had sensational increase from 2017 to 2018, but had has a decreasing trend throughout the rest of the period. It is not clear what have caused the increase in 2018, but possibble causes includes: police paying extra attention to these violations and drivers distracted by electronic devices.

As the list above shows, 'Unknown' is the fourth most common violation type, so the actual share of the specific violation types might be greater than visualized on the figure, but the tendencies are assumed to be reliable since the share of violation type marked 'Unknown' has been relatively constant throughout the period.
